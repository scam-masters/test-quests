# Drag and Drop 
To implement the drag and drop functionality, we used the react-dnd library (https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about).
The library provides a set of React components that can be used to create drag and drop interfaces. 
To drag and drop a item you have to click on the item, drag it to the desired location and drop it there.
